## 🧐 What to Expect: The Default Simulation

When you first open MoneyForge, a default simulation begins:

- **Agents begin in a pure barter economy.** They are assigned roles like Farmer, Miner, or Toolmaker and will try to trade for the goods they can't produce.
- You’ll see agents moving around their "settlements," producing goods, and attempting to trade with nearby agents.
- **Barter is hard.** Many attempted trades will fail because of a lack of a "double coincidence of wants."
- As barter fails, frustrated agents will observe the success of their money-using neighbors and may **spontaneously adopt money**.
- Currency adoption, wealth distribution, market prices, and trade activity are all visualized in real-time on the dashboard.
- Use the **controls** to adjust parameters, **intervene** with disasters or money printing, or **export** the simulation data to a JSON file.

## 🕹️ Basic Controls

- **Start / Pause:** Start and stop the simulation.
- **Reset:** Resets the current simulation to a fresh state (does not clear your saved game).
- **Clear Saved State:** Deletes the game state saved in your browser's `localStorage`.
- **Sliders:** Adjust core simulation parameters in real-time.
